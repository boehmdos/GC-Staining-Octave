% This is version 1.0, February 16, 2025.
% Developed and tested on Octave 3.9.0

% This function is the bottle-neck of GC staining.
% In Octave 9.3.0, this sequential processing was faster or more reliable than any tested alternative.
% If you are from the future, keep an open eye for alternatives.
% If you use Matlab, pdist2 is much faster (not in Octave 9.3.0).

% This function finds for every mass spectrum in the chromatogram the most similar spectrum (Best Matching Unit, BMU) on the reference map (SOM).
% To this end, the Euclidean distance (= difference) is calculated between every spectrum on the reference map and the currently processed spectrum of the chromatogram.
% The spectrum with the smallest distance is the most similar one.
% It is selected as BMU, and its coordinates and the calculated distance are recorded for the retention time of the processed chromatogram spectrum.
% The recorded chromatograms are then used to determine a color for the mass spectrum in the chromatogram and to draw a substance and a quantitative map.
