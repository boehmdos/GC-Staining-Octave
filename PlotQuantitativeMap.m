% This function plots a quantitative subtance map and saves it as a png.
% The intensities in each grid unit are summed up. The total intensitites are indicated on a dot plot in their repective grid coordinates. Color encodes the total intensity in each grid unit. Drawing order is from low to high total intensity, so that dots of high intensity are topmost.
% The summes intensities cover the orders of magnitude as requested by NumberofBins. With 4 bins, 4 orders of magnitudes are drawn, e. g. 10E8 to 10E4.
% Absent entries, entries with a TIC less than the lowest bin, entries with a too high difference to their BMU, and entries outside the hue/saturation maps are not drawn.


function y = PlotQuantitativeMap(FileName, Folder, Time, TIC, Locations, NumberofBins = 4, SomSize, Deselection, MinIntensity = NaN, MaxDistance = NaN)

% Make invisible the entries in the list of too low intensity/too high difference entries that was created in a previous function.
if ( Deselection > 0 ) % % Both low intensity signals and absent signals are depicted in white.Check if the list of filtered values exists.
Locations(Deselection(:), 1:2) = repmat([NaN, NaN], size(Deselection,1),1); % Set the locations of all filtered scans/BMUs to NaN. This way, they will not be drawn in the graph.
endif

% Entries with NaN coordinates are removed, otherwise the conversion of coordinates to indices doesn't work.
IdxNaN = isnan(Locations(:,1)); % Find all entries that have a NaN on the x-coordinate. Entries with a NaN *only* on the x or y coordinate should not exist. Should. This is potential breaking point.
Locations = Locations(~IdxNaN, 1:2); % Retain the locations that have valid coordinates.
TIC = TIC(~IdxNaN); % Extract the TICs of the entries with valid coordinates.

BMUIndex = [sub2ind(SomSize(1:2),Locations(:,1),Locations(:,2))]; % Convert the coordinates of the locations into indeces.
